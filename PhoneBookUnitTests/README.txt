API PhoneBook Project

* IN THIS FOLDER *******************************************************
This Folder contains two collection files:
PhoneBookUnitTest - 
	PhoneBook API.postman_collection.json
	PhoneBook Tests Demo.postman_collection.json

A Collection Format JSON file in Postman is a file that contains a collection of HTTP requests, each with its own set of properties and test scripts, organized into folders and sub-folders. It allows you to share your collection of requests with others, backup your requests, or import them into another Postman instance.

* HOW TO RUN ************************************************************
1. Open Postman and click on the "Import" button located in the top left corner of the window.
2. Select the "Import From File" option.
3. Browse your computer to find the Collection JSON file that you want to import.
4. Select the file and click on "Open".
5. Postman will import the collection and display it in the "Collections" tab.
6. You can now use the imported collection to send requests to the API and run tests on the responses.
